              <p>
                After analyzing survey results, the Office of Research and Evaluation categorized each question into one of five general topics.
                For each topic a score is constructed by calculating the % of responses to topic-related questions that are the best possible choice.

                On this page you can choose a topic to compare schools and other groups of students for each of these topics.
