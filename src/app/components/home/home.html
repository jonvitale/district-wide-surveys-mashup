                    Each year, students, parents/guardians, teachers, and principals at District and charter schools are invited to participate in a survey about their schools.
                    <br><br>
                    The feedback provides schools with stakeholder perspectives on what is working and what areas need to be improved.

              This interactive site displays the survey results in several ways. First, you can view how many people took the survey. As survey participation increases, the responses more accurately  reflect generalizable perceptions of a given school. You can also see comparisons and year-to-year changes in how people responded to the survey questions.
              <br><br>
              As you review this information, you may want to focus on response rates, responses across the key survey topics (e.g., "school climate"), or responses to individual questions (including select focus questions tied to district anchor goals).
